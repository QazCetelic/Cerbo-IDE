# Cerbo IDE

Cerbo is an integrated development environment for developing BLAZINGLY fast programs in Brainfuck, yet isn't written in Rust. It is actually written in Javaâ„¢ 17 and the completely irrelevant JavaFX UI framework that was removed since JDK 11.
The framework is added using a Gradle plugin because that's totally a reasonable way to load a library.
The plugin is very reliable and never randomly complains about improperly loaded JavaFX modules.

It allows developers to see immediately see the results by immediately running the code using an integrated parser and interpreter.
After the developer stops writing code it will display the resulting output above the code and will display a memory dump on the right side of the application.
Input can be given using the field below each code sheet.
